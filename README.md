## Preparing Iontophoresis Trays

How to prepare the trays for the experiment:

- Take two trays that are large enough to fit your hands flat on them and cover them with aluminium foil.
- Cut some plastic or rubber mesh to the same size as the trays and place them on top of the foil. This will prevent your hands from touching the foil directly.
- Fill the trays with water until the level reaches your palms when you place your hands on the mesh.
